    "# Building a Contextual RAG Workflow with Together AI on Union\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through building a Contextual RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflow on Union using Together's embedding, reranker, and chat models. It ties together web scraping, embedding generation, and serving into one cohesive application.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Union](https://www.union.ai/) is a production-grade AI orchestrator that unifies data, models, and compute workflows into a single, intuitive platform. It makes scalable, enterprise-ready AI accessible to all teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we take the [existing Contextual RAG Together app](https://docs.together.ai/docs/how-to-implement-contextual-rag-from-anthropic) and make it \"production-grade\" with Union — ready for enterprise deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/Union_serving.png\" alt=\"Description\" width=\"850\" height=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fetches all links to Paul Graham's essays.\n",
    "2. Scrapes web content to retrieve the full text of the essays.\n",
    "3. Splits the text into smaller chunks for processing.\n",
    "4. Appends context from the relevant essay to each chunk.\n",
    "5. Generates embeddings and stores them in a hosted vector database.\n",
    "6. Creates a keyword index for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "7. Serves a FastAPI app to expose the RAG functionality.\n",
    "8. Provides a Gradio app, using the FastAPI endpoint, for an easy-to-use RAG interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the notebook, we’ll dive into the Union features that simplify this entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is designed for local execution first, allowing you to test and validate it before deploying and scaling it on a Union cluster. This staged approach ensures smooth transitions from development to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the workflow, make sure to install `union`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install union\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local execution\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the required dependencies to ensure the workflow runs smoothly. Next, we define an actor environment, as the workflow relies on actor tasks throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Union Actors](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/actors) let us reuse a container and its environment across tasks, avoiding the overhead of starting a new container for each task. In this workflow, we define a single actor and reuse it consistently since the underlying components don’t require independent scaling or separate environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the actor environment, we specify the `ImageSpec`, which defines the container image that tasks in the workflow will use. With Union, every task runs in its own dedicated container, requiring a container image. Instead of manually creating a Dockerfile, we define the image specification in Python. When run on Union Serverless, the container image is built remotely, simplifying the setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also configure the actor’s replica count to 10, meaning 10 workers are provisioned to handle tasks, allowing up to 10 tasks to run in parallel, provided sufficient resources. The TTL (time to live) is set to 120 seconds, ensuring the actor remains active for this period when no tasks are being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we create a Pydantic `BaseModel` named `Document` to capture metadata for each document used by the RAG app. This model ensures consistent data structuring and smooth integration throughout the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Add your Together AI API key (`TOGETHER_API_KEY`) to the `.env` file before running the notebook."

This approach **significantly improves execution speed**. We set the concurrency to 2, meaning two tasks will run in parallel.

    "The final output of this workflow includes the BM25S keyword index and the contextual chunks mapping file, both returned as [Union Artifacts](https://docs.union.ai/serverless/user-guide/core-concepts/artifacts). The Artifact Service automatically indexes and assigns semantic meaning to all outputs from Union tasks and workflow executions, such as models, files, or other data. This makes it easy to track, access, and orchestrate pipelines directly through their outputs. In this case, the keyword index and file artifacts are directly used during app serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also set up a retrieval task to fetch embeddings for local execution. Once everything’s in place, we run the workflow and the retrieval task locally, producing a set of relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of running locally is that all tasks and workflows are Python functions, making it easy to test everything before moving to production. This approach allows you to experiment locally and then deploy the same workflow in a production environment, ensuring it’s production-ready. You get the flexibility to test and refine your workflow without compromising on the capabilities needed for deployment."
