    "**What is Reranking?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reranking is a two-stage process:\n",
    "1. **Initial Retrieval**: Use fast embedding-based search to get candidate documents\n",
    "2. **Reranking**: Use a more sophisticated model to reorder candidates based on query relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach combines the speed of embedding search with the precision of cross-attention models."
