    "1. We download the text for the bill.\n",
    "2. We craft a good summarization prompt template that can be passed into a LLM to generate a concise summary.\n",

    "[BERTScore](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score) is a nice evaluation metric that will give us an idea of how semantically relevant each chunk of the original document is to the summary and thus we can get an idea of which details the LLM chose to include/omit in the final summary."
