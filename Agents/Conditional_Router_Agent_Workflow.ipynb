    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll demonstrate how you can program an agent workflow that will dynamically change the LLM it uses to complete a task depending on the specialities of the models available to it and the requirements of the task at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "so for example, if given a coding task it should use a model specialized for coding(Qwen coder, or deepseek 2.5 pehaps), if we need to plan or reason you might want to use a completely different model to achieve this task and so on for other tasks!\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the goal we will create the following:\n",
    "1. LLM Router: A language model that will choose, providing a reason for its choice, the best route given a task.\n",
    "2. Simple API that executes the chosen model and solves the task."

    "<img src=\"../images/if_router.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this **conditional router agent workflow** we demonstrate how you can program a router LLM that will have access to multiple possiblities/routes - these routes can represent different LLMs, prompts, action sequences and potentially even completely different functionalities. The commonality is that given a task and information about when each route is preferable it needs to choose a route and provide reasoning for its choice. For the simplest implementation of this agent workflow only one path is activated per LLM call.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our specific usecase we need to select a model for a specific task, this task will break down as follows:\n",
    "1. Given a user prompt and information about routes available the Router LLM needs to output a JSON that contains -> `model_choice`, `reason`\n",
    "2. We will then use a simple LLM call to run `model choice` and return the Output response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets see the coded up implementation of this workflow.\n"

      "\n",
      "5. **Book Accommodations:**\n",
      "   - Choose accommodations based on location, budget, and preferences.\n",
      "   - Book in advance, especially during peak seasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Research Attractions and Activities:**\n",

      " In a faraway kingdom, there once lived a mighty dragon named Drako. He was known for his fiery breath and sharp claws, terrorizing the nearby villages and towns. The king of the land decided to send his bravest knight, Sir William, to slay the beast and bring peace to his people.\n",
      "Sir William set out on his quest, armed with his sword and shield. After days of riding through the dense forest, he finally saw the dragon's lair. The knight dismounted from his horse and slowly approached the cave entrance. He took a deep breath, bracing himself for the battle ahead.\n",
      "As he stepped into the dark cave, he heard a loud roar that sent shivers down his spine. The dragon emerged from the shadows, its fiery eyes fixed on the knight. The beast let out another deafening roar, and Sir William readied his sword.\n",
      "What happened next surprised everyone. Instead of attacking, Drako spoke to the knight. He told him about how lonely he had been, how he had been driven to terrorize the kingdom out of desperation. Sir William listened intently, realizing that the dragon was not inherently evil but rather misunderstood.\n",
      "The knight proposed a truce between them, offering to help Drako find a new home and food if he promised to stop terrorizing the towns. Drako agreed, and together they left the cave.\n",
      "The people of the kingdom were amazed to see the dragon and the knight walking side by side. Sir William explained what had happened, and the king agreed to the truce. Drako was given a new home in a remote part of the kingdom, far away from the towns, and he was provided with food to sustain him.\n",
      "From that day forward, the dragon and the knight became unlikely friends. They would often visit each other, and the people of the kingdom knew that they were safe from harm. The legend of the dragon and the knight lived on, teaching everyone that even the fiercest of enemies could become friends if given the chance.\n",
