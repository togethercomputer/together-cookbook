    "## Introduction\n",

    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how you can create an agent workflow that will execute multiple LLMs in parallel to solve the same task - proposing solutions which a final LLM aggregates into a response for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy, proposed in the [Mixture of Agents paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04692), shows results far beyond the capabilities of individual contributing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An architecture that enables multiple LLMs to solve a task in parallel and propose solutions\n",
    "2. An aggregator model that synthesizes individual proposals into one final answer"

    "In this **parallel agent workflow**, we demonstrate how you can orchestrate multiple LLMs to work simultaneously on the same task, with each model proposing its own solution. This approach leverages the collective intelligence of different models, with their responses being aggregated by a final LLM that synthesizes a comprehensive solution. Each model in the parallel workflow can have different capabilities or specialized knowledge, contributing unique perspectives to the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregator model then analyzes these various proposals to create an enhanced final response that builds upon the strengths of each individual contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our specific use case, the workflow breaks down as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a user prompt, multiple LLMs process the task in parallel, each generating their own proposed solution\n",
    "2. All individual responses are collected and passed to an aggregator LLM\n",
    "3. The aggregator LLM analyzes the collective proposals and synthesizes them into a final, improved response for the user\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see the coded implementation of this workflow.\n"

      "## Step 4: Substitute the given values into the formula and solve for P\n",
