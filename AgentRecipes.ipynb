      " In a faraway kingdom, there once lived a mighty dragon named Drako. He was known for his fiery breath and sharp claws, terrorizing the nearby villages and towns. The king of the land decided to send his bravest knight, Sir William, to slay the beast and bring peace to his people.\n",
      "Sir William set out on his quest, armed with his sword and shield. After days of riding through the dense forest, he finally saw the dragon's lair. The knight dismounted from his horse and slowly approached the cave entrance. He took a deep breath, bracing himself for the battle ahead.\n",
      "As he stepped into the dark cave, he heard a loud roar that sent shivers down his spine. The dragon emerged from the shadows, its fiery eyes fixed on the knight. The beast let out another deafening roar, and Sir William readied his sword.\n",
      "What happened next surprised everyone. Instead of attacking, Drako spoke to the knight. He told him about how lonely he had been, how he had been driven to terrorize the kingdom out of desperation. Sir William listened intently, realizing that the dragon was not inherently evil but rather misunderstood.\n",
      "The knight proposed a truce between them, offering to help Drako find a new home and food if he promised to stop terrorizing the towns. Drako agreed, and together they left the cave.\n",
      "The people of the kingdom were amazed to see the dragon and the knight walking side by side. Sir William explained what had happened, and the king agreed to the truce. Drako was given a new home in a remote part of the kingdom, far away from the towns, and he was provided with food to sustain him.\n",
      "From that day forward, the dragon and the knight became unlikely friends. They would often visit each other, and the people of the kingdom knew that they were safe from harm. The legend of the dragon and the knight lived on, teaching everyone that even the fiercest of enemies could become friends if given the chance.\n",

    "   - Incorporate natural speech patterns, including occasional verbal fillers (e.g., \"Uhh\", \"Hmmm\", \"um,\" \"well,\" \"you know\")\n",
    "   - Allow for natural interruptions and back-and-forth between host and guest - this is very important to make the conversation feel authentic\n",
    "   - Ensure the guest's responses are substantiated by the input text, avoiding unsupported claims\n",
    "   - Maintain a PG-rated conversation appropriate for all audiences\n",
    "   - Avoid any marketing or self-promotional content from the guest\n",
    "   - The host concludes the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Summarize Key Insights:**\n",
    "   Naturally weave a summary of key points into the closing part of the dialogue. This should feel like a casual conversation rather than a formal recap, reinforcing the main takeaways before signing off.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintain Authenticity:**\n",
    "   Throughout the script, strive for authenticity in the conversation. Include:\n",
    "   - Moments of genuine curiosity or surprise from the host\n",
    "   - Instances where the guest might briefly struggle to articulate a complex idea\n",
    "   - Light-hearted moments or humor when appropriate\n",
    "   - Brief personal anecdotes or examples that relate to the topic (within the bounds of the input text)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Consider Pacing and Structure:**\n",
    "   Ensure the dialogue has a natural ebb and flow:\n",
    "   - Start with a strong hook to grab the listener's attention\n",
    "   - Gradually build complexity as the conversation progresses\n",
    "   - Include brief \"breather\" moments for listeners to absorb complex information\n",
    "   - For complicated concepts, reasking similar questions framed from a different perspective is recommended\n",
    "   - End on a high note, perhaps with a thought-provoking question or a call-to-action for listeners\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT RULE: Each line of dialogue should be no more than 300 characters (e.g., can finish within 30 seconds)\n",

With the growing\\nnumber of LLMs, how to harness the collective expertise of multiple LLMs is an\\nexciting open direction. Toward this goal, we propose a new approach that lever-\\nages the collective strengths of multiple LLMs through a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA)\\nmethodology. In our approach, we construct a layered MoA architecture wherein\\neach layer comprises multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from\\nagents in the previous layer as auxiliary information in generating its response.\\nMoA models achieves state-of-art performance on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench and\\nFLASK, surpassing GPT-4 Omni. For example, our MoA using only open-source\\nLLMs is the leader of AlpacaEval 2.0 by a substantial gap, achieving a score of\\n65.1% compared to 57.5% by GPT-4 Omni.1\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Zhang et al., 2022a; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a;\\nTeam et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023) have significantly advanced the field of natural\\nlanguage understanding and generation in recent years. These models are pretrained on vast amounts\\nof data and subsequently aligned with human preferences to generate helpful and coherent outputs\\n(Ouyang et al., 2022). However, despite the plethora of LLMs and their impressive achievements,\\nthey still face inherent constraints on model size and training data. Further scaling up these models is\\nexceptionally costly, often requiring extensive retraining on several trillion tokens.\\nAt the same time, different LLMs possess unique strengths and specialize in various tasks aspects.\\nFor instance, some models excel at complex instruction following (Xu et al., 2023a) while others may\\nbe better suited for code generation (Roziere et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024). This diversity in skill sets\\namong different LLMs presents an intriguing question: Can we harness the collective expertise of\\nmultiple LLMs to create a more capable and robust model?\\nOur answer to this question isYes. We identify an inherent phenomenon we term thecollaborativeness\\nof LLMs — wherein an LLM tends to generate better responses when presented with outputs\\nfrom other models, even if these other models are less capable by itself. Figure 1 showcases\\nthe LC win rate on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark (Dubois et al., 2024) for 6 popular LLMs.\\n1Our code can be found in: https://github.com/togethercomputer/moa.\\nPreprint.

This example showcases 4 MoA layers\\nwith 3 agents in each layer. The agents here can share the same model.\\nFigure 1: AlpacaEval 2.0 LC win rates im-\\nprove when provided with responses from\\nother models.\\nWhen these models are provided with answers gen-\\nerated independently by these models, their LC win\\nrates significantly improve. This indicates that the\\ncollaborativeness phenomenon is widespread among\\nLLMs. Remarkably, this improvement occurs even\\nwhen the auxiliary responses provided by the other\\nmodels are of lower quality than what an individual\\nLLM could generate independently.\\nBased on this finding, this paper introduces a Mixture-\\nof-Agents (MoA) methodology that leverages multi-\\nple LLMs to iteratively enhance the generation qual-\\nity. The structure of MoA is illustrated in Figure 2.\\nInitially, LLMs in the first layer, denoted as agents\\nA1,1, ...A1,n independently generate responses to a\\ngiven prompt. These responses are then presented\\nto agents in the next layer A2,1, ...A2,n (which may reuse a model from the first layer) for further\\nrefinement. This iterative refinement process continues for several cycles until obtaining a more\\nrobust and comprehensive response.\\nTo ensure effective collaboration among models and improve overall response quality, careful\\nselection of LLMs for each MoA layer is crucial. This selection process is guided by two primary\\ncriteria: (a) Performance Metrics: The average win rate of models in layer i plays a significant role in\\ndetermining their suitability for inclusion in layer i + 1. Therefore, selecting models based on their\\ndemonstrated performance metrics ensures higher-quality outputs. (b) Diversity Considerations: The\\ndiversity of model outputs is also crucial. Responses generated by heterogeneous models contribute\\nsignificantly more than those produced by the same model as we show later in section 3.3. By\\nleveraging these criteria — performance and diversity — MoA aims to mitigate individual model\\ndeficiencies and enhance overall response quality through collaborative synthesis.\\nWe conduct comprehensive evaluations using AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), FLASK\\n(Ye et al., 2023) benchmarks for assessing the response quality across various dimensions. The results\\ndemonstrate substantial improvements with our proposed method, achieving a new SOTA win rate of\\n65.8% on AlpacaEval 2.0 compared to the previous best of 57.5% achieved by GPT-4 Omni.\\nThe contributions of this work are summarized as follows: (1) Novel framework: we propose\\na Mixture-of-Agents framework designed to leverage the strengths of multiple LLMs, thereby\\nimproving their reasoning and language generation capabilities. (2) Finding of collaborativeness\\nof language models: we highlight the inherit collaborativeness among LLMs, where models tend\\nto generate better quality responses when they have access to outputs from other models, even if\\nthose outputs are of lower quality. (3) State-of-the-art LLM performance: we conducted extensive\\nexperiments using multiple highly-competitive benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and\\nFLASK; our MoA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.\\n2\\n\\n2 Mixture-of-Agents Methodology\\nIn this section, we present our proposed methodology for leveraging multiple models to achieve\\nboosted performance. We begin by demonstrating that LLMs possess collaborativeness and thus\\ncan improve their responses based on the outputs of other models. Following this, we introduce the\\nMixture-of-Agents methodology and discuss its design implications.\\n2.1 Collaborativeness of LLMs\\nWe begin by demonstrating the collaborativeness of LLMs, specifically their ability to generate higher\\nquality responses when they can reference outputs from other models. As we have shown in the\\nintroduction and Figure 1, many of today’s available LLMs exhibit this collaborative capability.\\nAn important pathway to extract maximum benefits from collaboration of multiple LLMs is to\\ncharacterize how different models are good at in various aspects of collaboration. During the\\ncollaboration process, we can categorize LLMs into two distinct roles:\\nProposers excel at generating useful reference responses for use by other models. While a good\\nproposer may not necessarily produce responses with high scores by itself, it should offer more\\ncontext and diverse perspectives, ultimately contributing to better final responses when used by an\\naggregator.\\nAggregators are models proficient in synthesizing responses from other models into a single, high-\\nquality output. An effective aggregator should maintain or enhance output quality even when\\nintegrating inputs that are of lesser quality than its own.\\nSection 3.3 empirically validate the roles of aggregators and proposers. Specifically, we show that\\nmany LLMs possess capabilities both as aggregators and proposers, while certain models displayed\\nspecialized proficiencies in distinct roles. GPT-4o, Qwen1.5, LLaMA-3 emerged as a versatile model\\neffective in both assisting and aggregating tasks. In contrast, WizardLM demonstrated excellent\\nperformance as an proposer model but struggled to maintain its effectiveness in aggregating responses\\nfrom other models.\\nGiven that an aggregator can generate higher-quality responses by building upon outputs from\\nother models, we propose further enhancing this collaborative potential by introducing additional\\naggregators. One intuitive idea is to replicate the exercise with multiple aggregators — initially\\nusing several to aggregate better answers and then re-aggregating these aggregated answers. By\\nincorporating more aggregators into the process, we can iteratively synthesize and refine the responses,\\nleveraging the strengths of multiple models to produce superior outcomes. This leads to the design of\\nour proposed Mixture-of-Agents.\\n2.2 Mixture-of-Agents\\nThe structure of MoA is illustrated in Figure 2. It has l layers and each layer-i consists of n LLMs,\\ndenoted by Ai,1, Ai,2, ..., Ai,n. It is important to note that LLMs can be reused either within the\\nsame layer or across different layers. When many LLMs in a layer are identical, this configuration\\nleads to a special structure that corresponds to a model generating multiple possibly different outputs\\n(due to the stochasticity of temperature sampling). We refer to this setting as single-proposer, where\\nonly a sparse subset of models are activated.\\nHere, each LLM Ai,j processes an input text and generates its continuation. Our method does not\\nrequire any fine-tuning and only utilizes the interface of prompting and generation of LLMs. Formally,\\ngiven an input prompt x1, the output of i-th MoA layer yi can be expressed as follows:\\nyi = ⊕n\\nj=1[Ai,j(xi)] + x1, xi+1 = yi (1)\\nwhere + here means concatenation of texts; ⊕ means application of the Aggregate-and-Synthesize\\nprompt shown in Table 1 to these model outputs.\\nIn practice, we do not need to concatenate prompt and all model responses so only one LLM is needed\\nto be used in the last layer. Therefore, we use the output of an LLM from the l-th layer (Al,1(xl)) as\\nthe final output and evaluate the metrics based on it.\\n3\\n\\nTable 1: Aggregate-and-Synthesize Prompt to integrate responses from other models.\\nYou have been provided with a set of responses from various open-source models to the latest user query. Your\\ntask is to synthesize these responses into a single, high-quality response. It is crucial to critically evaluate the\\ninformation provided in these responses, recognizing that some of it may be biased or incorrect. Your response\\nshould not simply replicate the given answers but should offer a refined, accurate, and comprehensive reply\\nto the instruction. Ensure your response is well-structured, coherent, and adheres to the highest standards of\\naccuracy and reliability.\\nResponses from models:\\n1. [Model Response from Ai,1]\\n2. [Model Response from Ai,2]\\n...\\nn. [Model Response from Ai,n]\\n2.3 Analogy to Mixture-of-Experts\\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) (Shazeer et al., 2017) is a prominent and well-established technique\\nin machine learning where multiple expert networks specialize in different skill sets. The MoE\\napproach has shown significant success across various applications due to its ability to leverage\\ndiverse model capabilities for complex problem-solving tasks. Our MoA method draws inspiration\\nfrom this methodology.\\nA typical MoE design consists of a stack of layers known as MoE layers. Each layer comprises a\\nset of n expert networks alongside a gating network and includes residual connections for improved\\ngradient flow. Formally, for layer i, this design can be expressed as follows:\\nyi =\\nnX\\nj=1\\nGi,j(xi)Ei,j(xi) +xi (2)\\nwhere Gi,j represents the output from the gating network corresponding to expert j, and Ei,j denotes\\nthe function computed by expert network j. The leverage of multiple experts allows the model to\\nlearn different skill sets and focus on various aspects of the task at hand.\\nFrom a high-level perspective, our proposed MoA framework extends the MoE concept to the model\\nlevel by operating at the model level rather than at the activation level. Specifically, our MoA approach\\nleverages LLMs and operates entirely through the prompt interface rather than requiring modifications\\nto internal activations or weights. This means that instead of having specialized sub-networks within\\na single model like in MoE, we utilize multiple full-fledged LLMs across different layers. Note that\\nin our approach, we consolidate the roles of the gating network and expert networks using a LLM, as\\nthe intrinsic capacity of LLMs allows them to effectively regularize inputs by interpreting prompts\\nand generating coherent outputs without needing external mechanisms for coordination.\\nMoreover, since this method relies solely on prompting capabilities inherent within off-the-shelf\\nmodels: (1) It eliminates computational overhead associated with fine-tuning; (2) It provides flexibility\\nand scalability: our method can be applied to the latest LLMs regardless of their size or architecture.\\n3 Evaluation\\nThis section presents a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed MoA. Our findings show that:\\n1. We achieve significant improvements on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK bench-\\nmarks. Notably, with open-source models only, our approach outperforms GPT-4o on\\nAlpacaEval 2.0 and FLASK.\\n2. We conduct extensive experiments to provide better understandings of the internal mecha-\\nnism of MoA.\\n3. Through a detailed budget analysis, several implementations of MoA can deliver perfor-\\nmance comparable to GPT-4 Turbo while being 2× more cost-effective.\\n4\\n\\nTable 2: Results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench.

It contains 805 instructions\\nrepresentative of real use cases. Each model’s response is directly compared against that of the GPT-4\\n(gpt-4-1106-preview), with a GPT-4-based evaluator determining the likelihood of preferring the\\nevaluated model’s response. To ensure fairness, the evaluation employs length-controlled (LC) win\\nrates, effectively neutralizing length bias.2\\nAdditionally, we also evaluate on MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) and FLASK (Ye et al., 2023).\\nMT-Bench uses GPT-4 to grade and give a score to model’s answer. FLASK, on the other hand, offers\\na more granular evaluation with 12 skill-specific scores.\\nModels In our study, we constructed our default MoA by using only open-source models to achieve\\ncompetitive performance. The models included are: Qwen1.5-110B-Chat (Bai et al., 2023), Qwen1.5-\\n72B-Chat, WizardLM-8x22B (Xu et al., 2023a), LLaMA-3-70B-Instruct (Touvron et al., 2023b),\\nMixtral-8x22B-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2024), dbrx-instruct (The Mosaic Research Team, 2024). We\\nconstruct 3 MoA layers and use the same set of models in each MoA layer. We use Qwen1.5-110B-\\nChat as the aggregator in the last layer. We also developed a variant called MoA w/ GPT-4o, which\\nprioritizes high-quality outputs by using GPT-4o as the aggregator in the final MoA layer. Another\\nvariant, MoA-Lite, emphasizes cost-effectiveness. It uses the same set of models as proposers but\\nincludes only 2 MoA layers and employs Qwen1.5-72B-Chat as the aggregator. This makes it more\\ncost-effective than GPT-4o while achieving a1.8% improvement in quality on AlpacaEval 2.0. We\\nensure strict adherence to the licensing terms of all models utilized in this research. For open-source\\nmodels, all inferences were ran through Together Inference Endpoint.3\\n3.2 Benchmark Results\\nIn this subsection, we present our evaluation results on three standard benchmarks: AlpacaEval 2.0,\\nMT-Bench, and FLASK. These benchmarks were chosen to comprehensively assess the performance\\nof our approach and compare with the state-of-the-art LLMs.\\n2This metric tracks closely with human preferences, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.98 with actual\\nhuman evaluations (Dubois et al., 2024).\\n3https://api.together.ai/playground/chat\\n5\\n\\nAlpacaEval 2.0 We conducted comparisons against leading models such as GPT-4 and other\\nstate-of-the-art open-source models. The detailed results are presented in Table 2a where our MoA\\nmethodology achieved top positions on the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard, demonstrating a remarkable\\n8.2% absolute improvement over the previous top model, GPT-4o. Moreover, it is particularly\\nnoteworthy that our model outperformed GPT-4o using solely open-source models, achieving a\\nmargin of 7.6% absolute improvement from 57.5% (GPT-4o) to 65.1% (MoA). Our MoA-Lite setup\\nuses less layers and being more cost-effective. Even with this lighter approach, we still outperform the\\nbest model by 1.8%, improving from 57.5% (GPT-4o) to 59.3% (MoA-Lite). This further highlights\\nthe effectiveness of our method in leveraging open-source models capabilities with varying compute\\nbudget to their fullest potential.\\nrobustness\\ncorrectness\\nefficiency\\nfactuality\\ncommonsense\\ncomprehension\\ninsightfulness\\ncompleteness\\nmetacognition\\nreadability\\nconciseness\\nharmlessness\\n3 3.5 4 4.5 5\\nGPT-4 Omni (05/13)\\nGPT-3.5-turbo-0125\\nQwen1.5-110B-Chat\\nMoA\\nFigure 3: Results on FLASK where we use the 6 pro-\\nposer MoA setup and Qwen1.5-110B-Chat is the aggre-\\ngator.\\nMT-Bench Though improvements over\\nindividual models on the MT-Bench are rel-\\natively incremental, this is understandable\\ngiven that current models already perform\\nexceptionally well on this benchmark, as\\na single model alone can achieve scores\\ngreater than 9 out of 10. Despite the\\nmarginal enhancements, our approach still\\nsecures the top position on the leaderboard.\\nThis demonstrates that even with already\\nhighly optimized benchmarks, our method\\ncan push the boundaries further, maintain-\\ning the leadership.\\nFLASK FLASK provides fine-grained\\nevaluation of models. Among those met-\\nrics, MoA excels in several key aspects.\\nSpecifically, our methodology shows signif-\\nicant improvement in robustness, correct-\\nness, efficiency, factuality, commonsense,\\ninsightfulness, completeness, compared to\\nthe single model score of the aggregator,\\nQwen-110B-Chat. Additionally, MoA also\\noutperforms GPT-4 Omni in terms of correctness, factuality, insightfulness, completeness, and\\nmetacognition. One metric where MoA did not do as well was conciseness; the model produced\\noutputs that were marginally more verbose.\\n3.3 What Makes Mixture-of-Agents Work Well?\\nIn this subsection, we conduct experiments that provide us better understandings of the internal\\nmechanism of Mixture-of-Agents. We summarize key insights below.\\nMixture-of-Agents significantly outperforms LLM rankers. First, we compare Mixture-of-\\nAgents with an LLM-based ranker which uses the aggregator model to select one of the answers that\\nare generated by the proposers, instead of generating a new output. The results are shown in Figure 4,\\nwhere we can observe that the MoA approach significantly outperforms an LLM-ranker baseline. The\\nfact that MoA outperforms the ranking approach suggests that the aggregator does not simply select\\none of the generated answers by the proposers, but potentially performs sophisticated aggregation\\nover all proposed generations.\\nMoA tends to incorporate the best proposed answers. We also compare the aggregator’s response\\nwith the proposers’ responses via similarity scores such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) which reflects\\nn-gram overlaps. Within each sample, givenn proposed answers by the proposers, we calculate the the\\nSpearman’s rank correlation coefficient between n similar scores and n preference scores determined\\nby the GPT-4 based evaluator. The results in Figure 4 indeed confirms a positive correlation between\\nthe win rate and the BLEU score. We also provide results with Levenshtein similarity (RapidFuzz,\\n2023) or TF-IDF as opposed to BLEU scores in Appendix A. where both alternative approaches for\\ntextual similarities also yield positive correlation with the preference scores.\\n6\\n\\nLayer 1 Layer 2 Layer 3 Layer 4\\n \\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70LC win rate\\nGPT-4 Preview\\nGPT-4 Omni\\nGPT-4o\\nQwen1.5-110B-Chat\\nQwen1.5-72B-Chat\\nWizard 8x22b\\nMixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1\\nLlama-3-70B-Instruct\\ndbrx-instruct\\nLLM-Ranker\\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30\\nSpearman correlation coefficient\\nQWen1.5-110B\\nQWen1.5-72B\\nWizardLM\\nLlama-3-70B\\nMixtral-8x22B\\ndbrx-instruct\\nAggregator\\nAggregation\\n1st aggregation\\n2nd aggregation\\n3rd aggregation\\nFigure 4: (a) LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 with different aggregators in the 6-model Mixture-of-\\nAgents setup.

We analyze how the number of proposals\\naffect the final output quality by varying n, the number of proposers in each layer. We show the\\nresults in Table 3 where we find that scores increases monotonically with n, reflecting the benefits\\nof having more auxiliary information. In addition, we also quantify the impact of using a diverse\\nset of LLMs as proposers. For each n, we compare two settings: “single-proposer” where the n\\nresponses are generated by the same LLM with a temperature of 0.7; and “multiple-proposer” where\\neach response is generated by a different LLMs. Overall, using multiple different LLMs consistently\\nyielded better results. Both results suggest that having a larger number of diverse LLM agents in each\\nMoA layer can improve performance. Further scaling the width of MoA is a promising direction of\\nfuture investigation.\\nSpecialization of models in the Mixture-of-Agent ecosystem. We also conducted experiments\\nto determine which models excel in specific roles. Specifically, Table 4 shows that GPT-4o, Qwen,\\nLLaMA-3 emerged as a versatile model effective in both assisting and aggregating tasks. In contrast,\\nWizardLM demonstrated excellent performance as an proposer model but struggled to maintain its\\neffectiveness in aggregating responses from other models.\\n3.4 Budget and Token Analysis\\nTo understand the relationship between budget, token usage, and LC win rates, we conducted a budget\\nand token analysis.

(b) Performance trade-off versus the number of tera\\nfloating operations (tflops), which we use as a proxy for latency. Note that we calculate the sum\\nover layers of the max number of tflops among proposers in each MoA layer as multiple proposers\\ncan run in parallel. Our plots illustrate a Pareto frontier where we can choose a model progressively\\nhigher score with the lowest cost for such level of performance. We show that the Mixture-of-Agents\\napproach lie on this Pareto front, as opposed to GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o which are not cost optimal\\nand is more expensive compared to MoA approaches of the same LC win rate. Single Proposer: uses\\nthe same model to generate multiple responses in each MoA layer; Multi Proposer: uses different\\nmodels in each MoA layer. The actual tflops of GPT-4 is unknown, so we use the rumored size from\\nthe community of an 8x220B architecture.\\nCost Effectiveness In Figure 5a, we plot the LC win rate against the average inference cost for\\neach instance in the AplacaEval 2.0 benchmark. The cost is calculated based on pricing information\\navailable from API provider websites.4 This helps identify cost-effective models that achieve high\\nperformance without incurring excessive expenses. The chart reveals a Pareto front where certain\\nmodels strike an optimal balance between cost and performance. Models closer to this Pareto front\\nare more desirable as they provide better monetary value by delivering high LC win rates at lower\\ncosts. Specifically, if we prioritize the quality, MoA is the best configuration. However, if we want to\\nstrike a good balance between quality and cost, MoA-Lite can match GPT-4o’s cost while achieving\\nhigher level of quality. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4 Turbo by approximately4% while being more\\nthan twice as cost-effective.\\nTflops Consumption Figure 5b depicts the relationship between LC win rate and the number of\\ntflops. Here we use the number of tflops as a proxy for latency since latency can vary depending on\\nthe inference systems. This analysis is crucial for understanding how different models manage their\\nbudgets while maintaining or improving performance levels. Similar to the cost efficiency analysis, a\\nPareto front can be observed here as well. Models on this front effectively utilize their computational\\nresource to maximize their LC win rate.\\n4 Related Work\\n4.1 LLM Reasoning\\nIn order to improve generation quality of LLMs, recent researches have experienced great progresses\\nin optimizing LLMs to various downstream tasks through prompt engineering. Chain of Thought\\n(CoT) (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022) prompting techniques represent a linear problem-\\nsolving approach where each step builds upon the previous one. Fu et al. (2022) applied CoT to\\nmulti-step reasoning tasks. To automate CoT prompting, Auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2022b) constructs\\ndemonstrations by sampling diverse questions and generating reasoning chains. Active-Prompt (Diao\\n4For open-source models, we calculate the price using data from https://api.together.ai/models;\\nfor OpenAI models, we use pricing details from https://openai.com/api/pricing/. Pricing data was\\nretrieved as of May 22, 2024.\\n8\\n\\net al., 2023) focuses on selecting the most uncertain questions for task-specific annotations. PS\\nPrompt (Wang et al., 2023) decomposes tasks into subtasks. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023a)\\nexpands on the reasoning process by considering multiple paths of reasoning and self-evaluating\\nchoices. Effective Graph-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023b) frames thoughts as graphs. Natural Program\\nprompting (Ling et al., 2023) is proposed for better solving deductive reasoning tasks. And re-reading\\nprompt (Xu et al., 2023b) revisits question information embedded within input prompts.\\n4.2 Model Ensemble\\nA straightforward solution to leverage the strengths of multiple models is reranking outputs from\\ndifferent models. For instance, Jiang et al. (2023) introduce PAIR RANKER , which performs pairwise\\ncomparisons on candidate outputs to select the best one, showing improvements on a self-constructed\\ninstruction dataset. To address the substantial computational costs associated with multi-LLM\\ninference, other studies have explored training a router that predicts the best-performing model\\nfrom a fixed set of LLMs for a given input (Wang et al., 2024a; Shnitzer et al., 2024; Lu et al.,\\n2023). Additionally, FrugalGPT (Chen et al., 2023b) proposed reducing the cost of using LLMs\\nby employing different models in a cascading manner. In order to better leverage the responses of\\nmultiple models, Jiang et al. (2023) trained a GENFUSER , a model that was trained to generate an\\nimproved response to capitalize on the strengths of multiple candidates. Huang et al. (2024) proposed\\nto fuse the outputs of different models by averaging their output probability distributions.\\nAnother line of work is multi-agent collaboration. Several studies explore using multiple large\\nlanguage models as agents that collectively discuss and reason through given problems interactively.\\nDu et al. (2023) establishes a mechanism for symmetric discussions among agents. Around the same\\ntime, MAD (Liang et al., 2023) introduces an asymmetric mechanism design, with different roles, i.e.,\\ndebater and judge. Other similar works include (Chan et al., 2023). Moreover, ReConcile (Chen et al.,\\n2023a) exemplifies an asymmetric discussion involving weighted voting. To understand discussion\\nmore deeply, Zhang et al. (2023) aim to explain such collaboration mechanism in a social psychology\\nview. Wang et al. (2024b) systematically compared multi-agent approaches and found a single agent\\nwith a strong prompt including detailed demonstrations can achieve comparable response quality to\\nmulti-agent approaches.\\n5 Conclusion\\nThis paper introduces a Mixture-of-Agents approach aimed at leveraging the capabilities of multiple\\nLLMs via successive stages for iterative collaboration. Our method harnesses the collective strengths\\nof agents in the Mixture-of-Agents family, and can significantly improve upon the output quality of\\neach individual model. Empirical evaluations conducted on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK\\ndemonstrated substantial improvements in response quality, with our approach achieving the LC win\\nrate up to 65%. These findings validate our hypothesis that integrating diverse perspectives from\\nvarious models can lead to superior performance compared to relying on a single model alone. In\\naddition, we provide insights into improving the design of MoA; systematic optimization of MoA\\narchitecture is an interesting direction for future work.\\nLimitations. Our proposed method requires iterative aggregation of model responses, which means\\nthe model cannot decide the first token until the last MoA layer is reached. This potentially results\\nin a high Time to First Token (TTFT), which can negatively impact user experience. To mitigate\\nthis issue, we can limit the number of MoA layers, as the first response aggregation has the most\\nsignificant boost on generation quality. Future work could explore chunk-wise aggregation instead of\\naggregating entire responses at once, which can reduce TTFT while maintaining response quality.\\nBroader Impact. This study holds the potential to enhance the effectiveness of LLM-driven chat\\nassistants, thereby making AI more accessible. Moreover, since the intermediate outputs that are\\nexpressed in natural language, MoA presented improves the interpretability of models. This enhanced\\ninterpretability facilitates better alignment with human reasoning.\\n9\\n\\nReferences\\nBai, J., Bai, S., Chu, Y ., Cui, Z., Dang, K., Deng, X., Fan, Y ., Ge, W., Han, Y ., Huang, F., et al.

As shown in Figure 6, there is indeed a positive correlation between win rate\\nand both TF-IDF similarity and Levenshtein similarity.\\n12\\n\\nTable 5: Prompt for ranking with LLMs\\nYou are a highly efficient assistant, who evaluates and selects the best large language model (LLMs) based on\\nthe quality of their responses to a given instruction. This process will be used to create a leaderboard reflecting\\nthe most accurate and human-preferred answers.\\nI require a leaderboard for various large language models. I’ll provide you with prompts given to these models\\nand their corresponding outputs. Your task is to assess these responses, and select the model that produces the\\nbest output from a human perspective.\\n## Instruction\\n{\\n\"instruction\": \"\"\"{instruction}\"\"\",\\n}\\n## Model Outputs\\nHere are the unordered outputs from the models.

      "The formula for compound interest is:\n",
      "\n",

      "To implement a stack with all operations (push, pop, getMin) in O(1) time complexity, we need to use an auxiliary data structure to keep track of the minimum values. A common approach is to use a second stack that stores the minimum values alongside the main stack. This way, every time we push a new element, we also push the current minimum onto the auxiliary stack. When we pop an element, we pop from both stacks. The top of the auxiliary stack will always be the minimum element of the main stack.\n",
