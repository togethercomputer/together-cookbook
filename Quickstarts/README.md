## 🚀 What You'll Learn

### Getting Started
- Setting up the Together AI client
- Making basic chat completion requests
- Working with long context (1M+ tokens)
- Using system prompts for persona-based conversations
- Exploring multilingual capabilities
- Understanding multimodal features with Llama 4 Scout

### Advanced Techniques
- **Thinking-Augmented Generation:** Learn to give smaller models reasoning capabilities by using DeepSeek R1's chain-of-thought tokens
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Extract entities and relationships from text using constrained generation with JSON schemas

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Thinking-Augmented Generation:**
- Math and logic problems
- Complex question answering
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Budget-constrained deployments needing reasoning

**Knowledge Graphs:**
- Document understanding
- Relationship mapping
- Information extraction
- Building semantic networks

## Prerequisites

- Together AI API key (sign up for free [here](https://api.together.ai/signin))
- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering
