    "This notebook demonstrates how to use PydanticAI with open source models  to create intelligent agents that work together to:\n",
    "1. Search for flights: The main agent processes user requests to find flights matching specific criteria\n",
    "2. Extract flight information: A secondary agent parses flight details from web page text\n",
    "3. Validate results: The framework ensures flights meet the requested origin, destination, and date\n",
    "4. Handle seat selection: Another agent interprets user seat requests using natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "Key PydanticAI concepts shown:\n",
    "- Strongly typed agents: Using Pydantic models to define expected outputs\n",
    "- Agent tools: The main agent calls the extraction agent as a tool\n",
    "- Result validation: Procedural validation ensures results meet requirements\n",
    "- Message history: Preserving context between interactions\n",
    "- Usage limits: Preventing excessive API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern can be extended to more complex workflows and other domains beyond travel booking.\n",
